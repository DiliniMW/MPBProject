# MPBProject
Design of a Polymer Photonic Structure

Project Overview

This repository contains the project files for the design and simulation of polymer photonic structures as part of the MEng in Electronic and Computer Engineering program at Dublin City University (DCU). The primary objective of this project is to explore the capabilities of the MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) software in simulating and engineering photonic band gaps (PBGs) in various polymer-based photonic structures.

Contents

Project Portfolio: A comprehensive document detailing the project objectives, methodologies, results, and analysis.
Control Files: Scheme-based control files used for simulations in MPB.
Simulation Results: Output files and plots generated from the MPB simulations.
Scripts: Bash scripts for data extraction, processing, and plotting.

Project Goals

Design and Simulation:
Simulate the band structures of polymer photonic structures with various lattice geometries (triangular, square, and honeycomb).
Use two different polymers with distinct dielectric constants to observe the effects on PBGs.

Data Analysis:
Extract and analyze band structures to identify complete and incomplete photonic band gaps.
Visualize electric field distributions to gain insights into the origin of the band gaps.

Key Findings
Triangular Lattice: Achieved the broadest PBGs, suggesting a strong potential for applications in optical filters and polarizers.
Material Comparison: Demonstrated that higher dielectric contrast leads to wider and more effective band gaps.
Simulation Tools: Validated the use of MPB as an effective tool for photonic structure design.

How to Use

Setting Up the Environment:
Install the necessary dependencies for MPB and other related tools on a Linux environment (e.g., Ubuntu).
Use provided control files to replicate simulations or modify parameters for custom simulations.

Running Simulations:
Execute the control files using MPB to generate output files containing band structure information.
Use the provided bash scripts to process and plot the data.

Analyzing Results:
Refer to the simulation results and visualizations to understand the PBGs and their implications for photonic applications.
